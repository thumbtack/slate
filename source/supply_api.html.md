# Introduction

The purpose of this API is to enable Supply Partners to integrate Thumbtack leads into their customer
acquisition workflows. This is accomplished by supporting two functions - **(1) lead transfer** and
**(2) two way messaging**. To support lead transfer, the Supply Partner will expose an API endpoint that
Thumbtack will call. To support two way messaging, both Thumbtack and the Supply Partner will expose
API endpoints for the other party to call.

Partners currently need approval to integrate with us. To request approval, feel free to reach out to us at teampartnerships AT thumbtack DOT com

Your use of our API is subject to Thumbtack's <a href='#api-terms-of-use'>API Terms of Use</a>.

# Authentication

## STEP 1: Get Client Credentials

Contact Thumbtack Partnership team for get the client-side credentials. These credentials will contain these two piece of information:

* Client ID / Consumer Key 

* Client Secret / Consumer Secret

While requesting the client credentials, partners will have to provide redirectURL to the Thumbtack team.

### Test OAuth flow during API Integration

Partners can test the OAuth flow by requesting the test client. They will need two separate clients for testing and production. 
They will have to contact the Thumbtack partnership team for creating the test client which will allow you to test the entire OAuth flow.
They will have to provide different redirectURL for the Production credentials and staging credentials.

## STEP 2: Connect Thumbtack account with Partner
> Sample URL

```
https://thumbtack.com/services/partner-connect/?client_id=THUMBTACK%20INTERNAL&redirect_uri=http://redirect.thumbtack.com&response_type=code&scope=messages
```

Use the consumer key as a client_ID that Thumbtack provided to you to request an AuthCode. Also, include the redirect_url so that  Thumbtack knows where to redirect users after they authorize access to their data.

`https://thumbtack.com/services/partner-connect/?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URL>&response_type=code&scope=<SCOPE>`

### Expected Parameters in the URL

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------
client_id | string | Consumer key provided by Thumbtack | Y
scope | string | Authorization scopes allow to access specific information from Thumbtack.| Y
redirect_uri | string | Thumbtack redirects Pro to this URL after they authorization | N
response_type | string | Must contain string `code` as a response type | Y
state | string | Client can insert state information that will be appended to the redirect_uri upon success user authorization | N

### Authorization scopes

Partners will have to pass the relevant scope with which they want to integrate. 
Partners can pass multiple scopes if they want to integrate with multiple Thumbtack endpoints.
The Access token issued will be limited to the scopes granted.

Available scopes:

* messages 
  
* availability
  
* bookings
  
* targeting 

### Test OAuth flow during API Integration
> Sample URL

```
https://thumbtack.com/services/partner-connect/?client_id=%3CCLIENT_ID%3E&redirect_uri=%3CREDIRECT_URL%3E&response_type=code&scope=messages
```

Partners will be able to get the AuthCode with the test Client via partner connect URL.

## STEP 3: Pro Authorizes Partner

Pro can select the Thumbtack Business name from the dropdown and click on the “Confirm Connection” button to Authorize that partner.

### Test OAuth flow during API Integration

<span style="color:Red">**NOTE:**</span> If Partners are using test Client, they can generate the Auth-code as many times as they want. 
They are not required to disconnect the flow before issuing the Auth-Code again.

## STEP 4: Authorization Code
> Sample URL when Redirect URL is https://redirect.thumbtack.com

```
https://redirect.thumbtack.com/?code=BnCICCQ9KWF6WXj_xtiN3A
```

After confirming the connection, There are two ways the client will receive auth-code:

* If the client sends `redirect_uri` in the URL(step-1), then Thumbtack redirects the pro to a third-party URL with the authorization code in the URL. Redirection URL will look like below:

`<REDIRECT_URL>/?code=<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>&scope=<SCOPE>
`

* If the client does not send `redirect_uri` in the URL(step-1), then the client will see auth code like below.

![image info](images/authcode_2.png)

### Expected Parameters in the URL
Parameter | Type | Description 
--------- | ---- | ----------- 
code | string | Authorization code appended to redirect_url in the previous step

Grab the Authorization Code and follow the below steps to get the Access Token.

<span style="color:Green">***Auth code expiry time - 5 minutes***</span>

### Test OAuth flow during API Integration
> Sample URL when Redirect URL is https://redirect.thumbtack.com

```
https://redirect.thumbtack.com/?code=BnCICCQ9KWF6WXj_xtiN3A&scope=messages
```

This step issues the auth-code for test client same as the production flow. Please check the above information for more details.

<span style="color:Red">**NOTE:**</span> If Partners are using test Client, they can generate the Auth-code as many times as they want.
They are not required to disconnect the flow before issuing the Auth-Code again.

## STEP 5: Request Access Token

   "token_type": "bearer",
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "refresh_token": "_s3cnwGAb5VgBt-CmYFSOw"
}
```

Once the pro authorizes access, the user is redirected back to the URL with the authorization code. This API will use an authorization code from the request return access token and refresh token in the response.

### Request Endpoint

`POST https://pro-api.thumbtack.com/v2/tokens/access`

### Request Header

`Authorization: Basic <B64-encoded_oauth_credentials>`

The `Authorization: Basic` authorization header is generated through a Base64 encoding of `<client_id>:<client_secret>`.
You can use https://www.base64encode.org/ to see how headers should be encoded.

### Expected Request Params

   "access_token": "1.eyJCdXNpbmVzc1BLIjozMTQxNDgwOTYyOTIxODQyNDMsIkNsaWVudElEIjoiVEhVTUJUQUNLIElOVEVSTkFMIiwiU2NvcGUiOltdLCJFeHBpcmVzQXQiOiIyMDIxLTEwLTE0VDAyOjQ1OjA2LjI4NjUwNzkxOFoiLCJTcmNBdXRoQ29kZSI6ImIzYzUzNjk3ZGU0ZTlmNWQxNTk2NDhmMGM2MTc3YWRhZTNiMGM0NDI5OGZjMWMxNDlhZmJmNGM4OTk2ZmI5MjQyN2FlNDFlNDY0OWI5MzRjYTQ5NTk5MWI3ODUyYjg1NSJ9.tgDkhV1ooM1C7UjWhZ_mCXbzF11YH4NgsweJdfvG-f8",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "expires_in": 3600,
   "refresh_token": "eoZNGASGdTWop1jINi-ouQ"
}
```

When Access Token expires, use the below API with refresh token which has a long lifetime, to get a new access token and refresh token pair.
### Request Endpoint

`POST https://pro-api.thumbtack.com/v2/tokens/access`

### Request Header

`Authorization: Basic <B64-encoded_oauth_credentials>`

The `Authorization: Basic` authorization header is generated through a Base64 encoding of `<client_id>:<client_secret>`.
You can use https://www.base64encode.org/ to see how headers should be encoded.

### Expected Request Params

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------
grant_type | string | Must contain string `refresh_token` as a grant type | Y
refresh_token | string | Refresh Token value that you received along with the access token in step:4 | Y
token_type | string | Must contain string `REFRESH` as a token type | Y

### Expected Response Params

Parameter | Type | Description | Required

expires_in | number | Access Token lifetime in seconds. The default expiry is `3600` seconds (1 hour).  | Y
refresh_token | string | The refresh token issued by the authorization server | Y

### Error handling with grace period 
We have implemented a grace period logic in OAuth refresh token flow to handle Network errors, Time-out errors or similar one.
If you receive `null` in the response to `/tokens/access` API at the time of refreshing the token,
we encourage Partners to implement the retry logic on their side which will call `/tokens/access` API with same refresh token to get the valid response.
<span style="color:Green">***Grace period time - 10 sec***</span>

### Test OAuth flow during API Integration

   "refresh_token": "_s3cnwGAb5VgBt-CmYFSOw"
}
```

Partners will be able to use the test auth-code and call /tokens API to get the test access token and refresh token pair in the /token API response.
Test token's behavior is the same as the production environment.

# Thumbtack Endpoints

Thumbtack will expose the following endpoints to Partners.
All endpoints should be versioned to support future schema changes.
Note that passing in the `Content-Type` header is required.

Removes tokens and disables the service on the Thumbtack side so which will allow the partner/pro to trigger the OAuth initialization flow again.
Endpoints will use HTTP basic authentication, and Thumbtack will provide 
Partners with a username and password for Partners to call these endpoints.

### HTTP Endpoint
`POST https://pro-api.thumbtack.com/v2/disconnect-partner`

### Request Header

`Authorization: Basic <B64-encoded_oauth_credentials>`

The `Authorization: Basic` authorization header is generated through a Base64 encoding of `<client_id>:<client_secret>`.
You can use https://www.base64encode.org/ to see how headers should be encoded.

### Expected Request Params

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------

}
```
Disconnect flow will remove all the previous auth-codes and tokens from the Thumbtack database.

<span style="color:Red">**NOTE:**</span> Thumbtack team will always recommend that partners should call this endpoint when they completed the testing so that Thumbtack can do a cleanup in order to remove older tokens and older auth codes.

## Targeting Endpoints

<span style="color:Red">**NOTE:**</span>
Please contact Thumbtack partnership team if you want to integrate with these endpoints.

Targeting preferences tell Thumbtack where you work when you work, and what kind of work you do. 
They also help the right customers find you. 
That’s why you need to set targeting preferences before you appear in Thumbtack search results.
To use these endpoints, partners will require to pass the `Bearer <access_token>` in the `Authorization` header.
Note that passing in the `Content-Type` header is required.

<span style="color:Red">**NOTE:**</span>
Please use the `targeting` scope while initializing the OAuth flow to use any of the targeting APIs.

# Development Guide

Please follow the steps outlined in this section to integrate with Thumbtack's API.

*Note that in order to call Thumbtack's test endpoints, Partners will need test credentials (username + password).
Please <a href='#contact-us'>contact us</a> and we will get you set up with the appropriate test credentials.*

## Build Partner Endpoints

The first step is to build the endpoints outlined in the <a href='#partner-endpoints'>Partner Endpoints</a> section.

Thumbtack supports both a test and production environment, so we recommend Partners to build both test and production
endpoints as well. At a minimum, it is recommended that Partners test their endpoints by calling them (using `curl` or
any similar tool) and validating that the endpoints return a successful `HTTP 200` response.

The purpose of this is to ensure that the Partner endpoints can accept the payloads Thumbtack will provide.
Feel free to use the sample request bodies provided throughout this guide to simulate the payloads Thumbtack will provide.

    "customer": {
        "customerID": "380497491930800133",
        "name": "John Davis"
    },
    "business": {
        "businessID": "380497492389642246",

> Sample Request

```shell
curl -X POST https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/test/create-lead
    -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    --user '<thumbtack_username>:<thumbtack_password>'
    -d '{
        "businessID": <business_id>
    }'
```

Once you have successfully created your endpoints, the next step is to test calling
<a href='#messages'>Thumbtack's messages endpoint.</a>.

In order to do this, you will need to provide a valid `businessID` and `leadID`. By valid, we mean the `businessID`
and `leadID` need to exist on Thumbtack. Thus, the Partner needs to create a dummy business and lead on Thumbtack's
test environment.

To do this, we have provided an endpoint Partners can call to generate this dummy data.

### HTTP Endpoint

`POST https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/test/create-lead`

Calling this endpoint will create a dummy business and lead on Thumbtack's test environment.
On the right, we've provided a sample request and response. Note that passing in the `Content-Type` header is required.

**Note**: For the sample request, the `businessID` field is optional (although if you have been provided a `businessID`,
it's recommended you provide it in the request. However, if you don't have a `businessID` you must provide an empty
data payload.

## Test Thumbtack Messaging Endpoint

Now that you've generated dummy data on Thumbtack's test environment, you should be able to test calling Thumbtack's
messages endpoint.

Take the `businessID` and `leadID` that were returned from calling `https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/test/create-lead`
and construct the appropriate Thumbtack messages endpoint.

In our case `businessID` is `380497492389642246` and `leadID` is `380497493950742534` so our Thumbtack messages endpoint
would look like - `https://api.thumbtack.com/v1/business/380497492389642246/lead/380497493950742534/message`.

However, **because we want to run this on our test environment**, we want to use the `staging-pro-api` host instead of
the `api` host. Thus, the endpoint we want to call would be `https://staging-pro-api.thumbtack.com/v1/business/380497492389642246/lead/380497493950742534/message`.

Call this endpoint as detailed in the <a href='#messages'>Thumbtack's messages endpoint</a> section, and validate
that you get a `success` response.

## Go To Production

At this point, the Partner's endpoints have been validated to accept Thumbtack payloads and the Partner has been
able to successfully call Thumbtack's endpoint to send a message. The next step is to move the integration to
Production.

To do this, the Partner needs to <a href='#contact-us'>contact Thumbtack</a> to set up Production credentials
for the Partner's integration as well as inform Thumbtack about the Partner's endpoints. A Thumbtack representative
will walk through the final steps to getting the Partner integrated onto the Thumbtack production environment.

Once a Partner has been fully set up on Production, Thumbtack will start pinging the Partner's endpoints
when a Partner receives both leads and messages from Thumbtack customers. The Partner will be expected to ping
Thumbtack's messages endpoint when they want to respond to a Thumbtack customer.
