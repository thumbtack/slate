# Introduction

The purpose of Thumbtack's Partner API is to enable Partners to seamlessly serve Thumbtack content on Partner
platforms. Currently, the content being served by the API includes information about Thumbtack categories and Pros.
However, our API is under active development, so we are constantly adding more content to the API upon request.  

Partners currently need approval to integrate with us. To request approval, feel free to reach out to us at teampartnerships AT thumbtack DOT com

Your use of our API is subject to Thumbtack's <a href='#api-terms-of-use'>API Terms of Use</a>.

# Partnership Mechanics

1. Partners show Thumbtack content (Pros and/or categories) on their platforms.   
2. Thumbtack provides links for each piece of content. These links contain partner tracking information, which allow
Thumbtack to attribute the Partner's users to the Partner.  
3. By clicking the Thumbtack content, the Partner's users are directed to Thumbtack.   
4. When a Partner's user contacts a Pro on Thumbtack, the associated revenue is shared with the Partner.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

 ```shell
 # With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
 curl "api_endpoint_here"
    -H "Authorization: AUTH_HEADER"
```

> Make sure to replace `AUTH_HEADER` with your personal header.
 
Where applicable, APIs use HTTP basic access authentication. Thumbtack will provide Partners with a username
and password. The basic header looks as follows:

`Authorization: Basic <encoding>`

`<encoding>` is the base64 encoding of the username followed by a colon, followed by the password.

Thumbtack will provide Partners with two sets of credentials - one for Thumbtack's test environment and 
one for Thumbtack's production environment.

# Endpoints

Thumbtack exposes the following endpoints for Partners. 
All endpoints are versioned to support future schema changes. 
Endpoints will use HTTP basic access authentication, and Thumbtack will provide 
Partners with username and password for Partners to call these endpoints.

## Pros

> Sample Request

```shell
curl https://api.thumbtack.com/v1/partners/discoverylite/pros?category=<category>&zip_code=<zip_code>&utm_source=<utm_source>

```

This endpoint is used to fetch a list of Thumbtack Pros for a given market. Markets are defined to be the combination
of a category and a zip code. Thumbtack will handle query translation for the Partner such that the Partner can provide
free form text as the category and Thumbtack will convert the provided text to the corresponding Thumbtack category. 
If a Partner does not have a query, they can directly provide the category name as the query.

Parameters for the endpoint will be passed in as URL query parameters.

### Parameters (passed in via URL)

Parameter | Type | Description | Required
--------- | ---- | ----------- | --------
category | string | Query string the user is searching for | N
category_pk | string | PK of the category that you received as a part of homecare/checklist API  | N
zip_code | string | Zip code the user is located in | Y
utm_source | string | Partner ID for attribution purposes | Y

**Note:**
In each request atlas one category specific parameter should be available. Either category or category_pk.
* If you are using /category API then pass a category with valid value in request.
* If you are using /homecare/checklist API then pass category_pk with valid PK in the request.

Routine upkeep can be vital in redirecting water away from your home, which helps prevent leaks, damage to your roof or water accumulating against your foundation. \n\nNeglecting to clean out your gutters can lead to a host of issues including basement flooding, overflow coming through your roofing and in cold climates ice damming, which can cause damage and even more leaks. These are issues that generally stem from more than one season of neglect, but should be taken seriously as any flooding or leak damage can cost thousands.",
