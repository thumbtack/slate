This Terms of Use Agreement ("Terms") govern your access to, use of, and participation in the Thumbtack Pro API (the “API”) made available by Thumbtack, Inc. ("Thumbtack", "we", "our", or "us") and the entirety of your relationship with Thumbtack with respect thereto (except for any written agreements concerning other aspects of your relationship with us).

PLEASE READ THE TERMS THOROUGHLY AND CAREFULLY. BY USING THE API, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE API.

All references to "you" or "your," as applicable, mean the person (natural or otherwise) who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the API in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors. If you use the API on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity and your acceptance of the Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that entity, and "you" and "your" herein shall refer to that entity, its directors, affiliates, officers, employees, and agents. Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Thumbtack Terms of Use, as they may exist at any given time at https://www.thumbtack.com/terms/ (the “Thumbtack Terms of Use”).
